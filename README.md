# Target-Document-Search
My implementation of the "Document Search" case study question

I implemented this case study challenge with a Node.js CLI. Read the following section to learn how to set up the project on your local machine.

## How to View Project
Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it for any OS platform using [this link.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Once you have Node installed, clone this repo, `cd` into it, and run the following command:

```
node index.js
```

You should now be prompted with some questions from your terminal. You're all set up!

## How to View Tests
`cd` into the cloned version of this repo if you haven't already, and run the following command:

```
node test.js
```
